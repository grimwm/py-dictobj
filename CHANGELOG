v0.2.2
======
Changelog started and prior versions added to this file.

Removed some code from MutableDictionaryObject.__setattr__
that is no longer needed now that DictionaryObject.__init__
properly handles initialization of __dict__ when passed in a
DictionaryObject.

v0.2.1
======
Improved the thoroughness of the documentation.

Added a description for PyPi.

v0.2
====
Fixed equality operators and the comparison method.

Fixed object copying when passing in another DictionaryObject.

Fixed handling of default values upon __init__.

Added __setstate__ / __getstate__ so pickle now works correctly
with the classes.

Fixed error reporting on exceptions.

Improved __repr__ so it gives a proper string represenation of
our classes so they can later be eval'd.

Added more unit tests:
 - test_pickle
 - test_copy
 - more equality tests

Added more examples to the documentation.

v0.1.1
======
First release.
